## üßæ About

**helloChat** is a simple, real-time web-based chat application built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.IO**. It supports multiple connected clients communicating instantly, with typing indicators and audio notifications for incoming messages.

This project demonstrates the basics of WebSocket communication, server-client interaction, and user-friendly real-time updates in a modular, easy-to-understand codebase.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Node.js & Express.js
- Socket.IO for WebSocket communication
- JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for frontend
- Audio notifications for new messages

---

## ‚úÖ Core Features

---

### 1. Real-time Chat

- Real-time, bi-directional messaging between clients via WebSockets.
- Messages include sender name, text content, and timestamp.
- Frontend displays messages from all connected clients instantly.

---

### 2. Typing Indicator

- Shows when a user is typing.
- Updates dynamically for all connected clients.

---

### 3. Connected Clients Count

- Displays current number of connected users in real-time.

---

### 4. Audio Notification

- Plays a sound when a new message is received by other clients.

---

## üìÑ Usage

- Enter your **name** and **message** in the input fields to start chatting.
- Messages sent appear instantly to all connected users.
- See real-time typing indicators when other users are typing.
- Watch the live count of connected users update dynamically.
- New messages from others trigger an audio notification.

---

## üéµ Audio Notification

- An audio sound plays whenever a new message is received from another user.
- The notification audio file is located at `public/message-tone.mp3`.

## üóÇ Architecture & Flow

The helloChat application uses a **centralized Socket.IO server** to manage real-time messaging between multiple clients. The following diagrams illustrate the high-level architecture and message flow.

    style ClientC fill:#9cf,stroke:#333
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Message Flow

```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
    participant C1 as Client 1
    participant S as Server
    participant C2 as Client 2

    C1->>S: 1. Emit "chat message"
    S-->>C1: 2. Acknowledge receipt
    S->>C2: 3. Broadcast to other clients
    Note right of C2: 4. Display message & trigger notification

```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Core Communication Flow

1. Client initiates WebSocket connection to the server.
2. Server establishes and maintains the connection.
3. Client sends different types of events:
   - Chat messages
   - Typing indicators
   - Connection/disconnection events
4. Server processes incoming events and broadcasts to clients.
5. Receiving clients update their UI accordingly, displaying messages, typing indicators, and updating the connected users count.
